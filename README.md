# All URLs

All URLs is a drop-in script for WordPress that gives you a list of all your public posts and terms. This includes posts, pages, custom post types, tags, categories and custom taxonomies. It also works with WPML.

## Usage

Put `index.php` in a subfolder of your WordPress root directory. Then open it in your browser.

When you are done with it it's probably a good idea to delete it from your production server. The links displayed are all public, so it's not a security matter, but you probably don't want Google to index it.

## FAQ

### Can you make this into a WordPress plugin?

If there is demand for it, I'd love to. Post or upvote an issue to let me know.

### Why should I use this and not a sitemap plugin?

If you want a sitemap, get a sitemap. Could a sitemap do the same job? Perhaps.
